    <p>Gaming has become a large influence on modern media and has developed some major titles in recent years. Here are some games I recommend to people who want to get into certain genres of gaming or new to gaming.</p>

      <div>
        <img src="eldenringP.jpg" alt="EldenringP" width="75%" class="eldenp">
      </div>
    <h2 class="eldenring">Elden Ring</h2>
    <p>Elden Ring is one of the most in depth open world games ever made. Fromsoft, the developers of games like Dark Souls, has managed to combine elements of a souls-like experience and immersion through world building and exploration. Although most would say it's on of the easier games in the series, this title alone managed to become Fromsoft's best selling game and get players who weren't familiar with the Souls Series to become interested in playing the other games they made prior to this release. Definitely a must to play.</p>
    <div>
        <img src="MHWI.jpg" alt="MHWI" class="MHWI" width="75%">
    </div>
    <h2 class="mhw">Monster Hunter World (Iceborne)</h2>
    <p>Monster Hunter World (Iceborne) is an RPG that has managed to build a huge following over the years as its long running series of games managed to get people interested in its core concept of hunting monsters and gathering their materials to fight bigger and stonger monsters. The 2016 release reinvented the series as you not only fight these monsters, but their ecology and overall role in the ecosystem managed to pursuade people as if it were a living and breathing world. If you want a lot of action, world immersion, beautiful graphics, and intense gameplay, this game is for you. Join the hunt.</p>
    <div>
      <img src="gottitle.jpg" alt="GOT" class="MHWI" width="75%">
    </div>
    <h2 class="mhw">Ghost of Tsushima</h2>
    <p>Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashinâ€™ good time.
